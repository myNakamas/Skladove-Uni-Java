# Skladove-Uni-Java
We got together of our own free will to try and do a project given from our university.
## What did we use:
IntelliJ IDEA

Hibernate as a framework to generate SQL commands

Xampp to run MYSQL and Apache server

Version control: Github

User interface: JavaFX with some CSS

Also, we kept track of the project through [our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/lPNXPLhl/java-skladove)
